Installation instructions:

1. To install the software package double click on install.bat
	- When presented with the unknown publisher warning click on install
	- Choose installation location and click continue
	- When asked to install Adobe Air click continue
	- If the program installed correctly the Pre-setup Tag Designer will launch automatically
		- When launched for the first time, it will prompt:
			"This is our first time running the PDS. A xml file has been created to 
			 store your items." - This means that no skus are in the database - use the 
			 add sku list.bat to import the skus list.

2. Included with the software launch is a complete xml with 61 sku preloaded.  This should cover
the majority of the units that are currently carried by most stores. Just type in the sku of the PC
of choice and the autoloader should load up the information. Remember, any additional skus should
be keyed manually using the Pre-setup software text fields.  

Enjoy the software, please email either Daniel Garcia or Jose Marin with any questions, bugs, 
errors, or suggestions on improving the software.

Thank you.
